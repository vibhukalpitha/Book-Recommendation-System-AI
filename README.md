# Book-Recommendation-System-AI

Just Launched: AI-Powered Book Recommendation System 📚🤖 Super excited to share my new project — an AI-powered Book Recommendation System that helps readers discover the perfect book based on their interests, mood, and reading goals. This system is fully powered by multiple real-time APIs, including: 🔹 Google Books API 🔹 Reddit API 🔹 YouTube API 🔹 SERP API (Search Engine Results) 🔹 News API 💡 What the System Does ✔️ Users can simply enter the type of book or topic they want ✔️ AI suggests the most relevant and popular books ✔️ Before reading, users can explore: • Real feedback • Reviews • Discussions • Social media opinions from multiple platforms — all in one place ✔️ Once the user reads a book, the system recommends additional books they may enjoy next ✔️ Designed to give a more personalized and research-backed reading experience 🔥 Why This Is Special Most book recommendation tools only use one database or rating system. My system goes beyond that — combining insights from social media, online discussions, YouTube summaries, search trends, and book databases to give users a truly informed decision before reading any book.
